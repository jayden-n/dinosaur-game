# Dinosaur Game Clone ðŸ¦–

The Dinosaur Game (also known as the Chrome Dino) is a browser game developed by Google and built into the Google Chrome web browser that I recreated to reinforce my JavaScript skills. The player can guide a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score.

## How To Play?

Pressing `space` or any key will cause the dinosaur to "jump". As the game progresses, the speed of play gradually increases until the user hits an obstacle, prompting an instant.
